<p> <b>Up to 235cm.</b>, as an adult, can weigh up to 115kg </p>
<p class="SturgeonFact"> Interesting fact: they are in trouble because their breding spots have been dammed up for hydro-electric power, and because of over-fishing<p>
<p class="aboutSturgeon"> habitats: lives in saltwater, breeds in freshwater in russia, parts of eastern europe, and central asia. diet: Mollusks, fish, crustaceans.<p>
<p class="status">status: CR (critically endangered)</p></span>

<p> <i>Acipenser Fulvescens</i>, <b class="SturgeonName">the Lake Sturgeon</b> </p>
<p> <b>up to 7.25ft long</b>, 108kg </p>
<p class="SturgeonFact"> Interesting fact: They reproduce every 4 or 5 years, and are also threatened because their eggs are taken before fertilization and served as caviar.<p>
<p class="aboutSturgeon"> habitats: North American warm fresh water. diet: worms, larvae, crayfish, snails. <p>
<p class="status"> status: LC (least concern)</p></span>

<span id="CommonSturgeon">
<p> <i>Acipenser sturio</i>, <b class="SturgeonName">the European Sea Sturgeon(or Atlantic sturgeon or Common sturgeon)</b> </p>
<p> <b>up to 20ft long</b>, 400kg </p>
<p class="SturgeonFact"> The wedge-shaped head of the European sea sturgeon ends in a long point. There are many sensitive barbels on the facial area.<br/>
Five longitudinal lines of large osseous plates are found on the body of the fish. The stomach is yellow and the back is a brownish grey.</p>
<p class="aboutSturgeon"> They are found on the coasts of Europe, except in the northernmost regions and the Baltic region, and have rarely even been known to cross the Atlantic Ocean to the coasts of North America. Like many other sturgeons, they spawn in the rivers inland from the coast. they eat mollusks and crustaceans. </p>

<span id="AtlanticSturgeon">
  
<p> <i>Acipenser oxyrinchus</i>, <b class="SturgeonName">the Atlantic Sturgeon</b> </p>
<span id="oxyrinchus">
<h5 class="subspecies"> Subspecies A. o. oxyrinchus </h5>

<p> <b>up to 15ft  long</b>, over 360kg </p>
<p class="SturgeonFact"> Rather than having true scales, the Atlantic sturgeon has five rows of bony plates known as scutes. They typically grow to be 6â€“8ft and no more than 140 kg. Its coloration ranges from bluish-black and olive green on its back to white on its underside.</p>

<p class="aboutSturgeon"> habitats: The main range of the Atlantic sturgeon is in eastern North America, extending from New Brunswick, Canada, to the eastern coast of Florida, United States. they eat mollusks and crustaceans. </p>
<p class="status"> status: NT (Near Threatened)</p></span>

<span id="destoi">
<h5 class="subspecies"> Subspecies A. o. desotoi </h5> <p>, <b class="SturgeonName">the Gulf Sturgeon</b> </p>

<p> <b>up to 15ft  long</b>, over 360kg </p>
<p class="SturgeonFact">  Adult Gulf sturgeon eat primarily, or possibly only, during the winter, when they are in marine or brackish water, and eat little to nothing during the remainder of the year when they are in rivers. Their weights vary in accordance with this eating pattern, with significant weight gains in the winter and smaller weight losses in the summer.</p>

<p class="aboutSturgeon"> habitats:  Critical habitat, reflecting the current range of the subspecies, has been designated (see map).<br/>
The historical range is thought to have been from the Suwannee River on the western coast of Florida to the Mississippi River, and marine waters of the central and eastern portions of the Gulf of Mexico. they eat mollusks and crustaceans. </p>

<p> <i>Acipenser baerii</i>, <b class="SturgeonName">the Siberian Sturgeon</b> </p>
<span id="baerii">
<h5 class="subspecies"> Subspecies A. b. baerii </h5>

<p> <b> 6.5ft  long</b>, ~65kg, The maximum recorded weight was 210 kg</p>
<p class="SturgeonFact"> Acipenser baerii baerii accounts for 80% of all Siberian sturgeon</p>

<p class="aboutSturgeon"> habitats: Acipenser baerii baerii resides in the Ob River and its tributaries. This subspecies migrates to mouth of the Ob during the winter due to seasonal oxygen deficiency, and swims thousands of kilometers upstream to spawn (breed). they eat mollusks and crustaceans. </p>
<p class="status"> status: EN (Endangered)</p></span>

<span id="baicalensis">
<h5 class="subspecies"> Subspecies A. b. baicalensis </h5> <p>, <b class="SturgeonName">the Baikal Sturgeon</b> </p>

<p> <b>up to 15ft  long</b>, over 360kg </p>
<p class="SturgeonFact"> The subspecies Acipenser baerii baicalensis constitutes the other 20% of the population. <br/>
Not long ago, sturgeons weighing 125 kilograms were not uncommon.</p>

<p class="aboutSturgeon"> habitats: A. b. baicalensis, known as the Baikal sturgeon, is a unique lake form found primarily in the northern end of Lake Baikal and migrates up the Selenga River to spawn. they eat mollusks and crustaceans.  It resides primarily in the northern end of the lake, making considerable movements along the shore, and migrating up the Selenga River to spawn.</p>

<span id="short-nose_sturgeon">
<p> <i>Acipenser brevirostrum</i>, <b class="SturgeonName">the Shortnose Sturgeon</b> </p>
<p> <b>mature at 45-55cm</b>, 9.3kg </p>
<p class="SturgeonFact"> The species is sometimes mistaken for juvenile Atlantic sturgeon, as adults of this species are similar in size to juveniles of that species. Prior to 1973, U.S. commercial fishing records did not differentiate between the two species, both were reported as "common sturgeon", although it is believed based on sizes that the bulk of the catch was Atlantic sturgeon.<br/></p>
<p class="aboutSturgeon">a small North American sturgeon, which can be found in 16 to 19 large river and estuary systems along the Atlantic seaboard from the Saint John River in New Brunswick, Canada, to the St. Johns River in Florida, United States. Populations may be disjunct, evidenced by lack of records in the sea outside the influence of their home river and minimal captures of tagged individuals outside the river in which they were tagged. they eat mollusks and crustaceans. </p>
