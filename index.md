<h2 id="sturgeon"> Sturgeons: </h2>

<p> <i>Acipenser Gueldenstaedtii</i>, <b>the Russian Sturgeon</b>. </p>
<p> <b>Up to 235cm.</b>, as an adult, can weigh up to 115kg </p>
<p> Interesting fact: they are in trouble because their breding spots have been dammed up for hydro-electric power, and because of over-fishing<p>
<p> habitats: lives in saltwater, breeds in freshwater in russia, parts of eastern europe, and central asia. diet: Mollusks, fish, crustaceans.<p>
<p>status: CR (critically endangered)</p>
  
<h3>| |</h3>

<p> <i>Acipenser Fulvescens</i>, <b>the Lake Sturgeon</b> </p>
<p> <b>up to 7.25ft long</b>, 108kg </p>
<p> Interesting fact: They reproduce every 4 or 5 years, and are also threatened because their eggs are taken before fertilization and served as caviar.<p>
<p> habitats: North American warm fresh water. diet: worms, larvae, crayfish, snails. <p>
<p> status: LC (least concern)</p>

<h3>| |</h3>

<p> <i>Acipenser sturio</i>, <b>the European Sea Sturgeon(or Atlantic sturgeon or Common sturgeon)</b> </p>
<p> <b>up to 20ft long</b>, 400kg </p>
<p> The wedge-shaped head of the European sea sturgeon ends in a long point. There are many sensitive barbels on the facial area.<br/>
Five longitudinal lines of large osseous plates are found on the body of the fish. The stomach is yellow and the back is a brownish grey.<p>
<p> They are found on the coasts of Europe, except in the northernmost regions and the Baltic region, and have rarely even been known to cross the Atlantic Ocean to the coasts of North America. Like many other sturgeons, they spawn in the rivers inland from the coast. they eat mollusks and crustaceans. <p>
<p> status: CR</p>

<p> <i>Acipenser oxyrinchus</i>, <b>the Atlantic Sturgeon</b> </p>

<h5> Subspecies A. o. oxyrinchus </h5>

<p> <b>up to 15ft  long</b>, over 360kg </p>
<p> Rather than having true scales, the Atlantic sturgeon has five rows of bony plates known as scutes. They typically grow to be 6â€“8ft and no more than 140 kg. Its coloration ranges from bluish-black and olive green on its back to white on its underside.<p>

<p> habitats: habitats: The main range of the Atlantic sturgeon is in eastern North America, extending from New Brunswick, Canada, to the eastern coast of Florida, United States. they eat mollusks and crustaceans. <p>
<p> status: NT (Near Threatened)</p>

<h5> Subspecies A. o. desotoi </h5>

<p> <b>up to 15ft  long</b>, over 360kg </p>
<p>  Adult Gulf sturgeon eat primarily, or possibly only, during the winter, when they are in marine or brackish water, and eat little to nothing during the remainder of the year when they are in rivers. Their weights vary in accordance with this eating pattern, with significant weight gains in the winter and smaller weight losses in the summer.<p>

<p> habitats:  Critical habitat, reflecting the current range of the subspecies, has been designated (see map).<br/>
The historical range is thought to have been from the Suwannee River on the western coast of Florida to the Mississippi River, and marine waters of the central and eastern portions of the Gulf of Mexico. they eat mollusks and crustaceans. <p>

<p> status: VU (Vulnerable)</p>
